Web Application Book Store Book Commenting

Build a comment system where a user can leave a comment on a book they purchased.

Sequence of Commenting:

Step 1) User purchases a book.

Step 2) User is them prompted with the choice of rating the book or not.

Step 3) If the user clicks the NO option or finishes rating the book it will move on to the comment prompt.

Step 4) The user is then prompted with the option of leaving a comment on the book or not.

Step 5) If the user selects the YES option they will then see a comment box pop up which allows upto 100 characters for a comment.

Step 6) After the user finishes the comment and submits it, the comment will be stored in a database.

Resources required: A database that allows methods to create an algorithm that will add the new comment to the book.

Database was sadly not created or implemented.
